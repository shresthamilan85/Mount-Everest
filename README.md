# Mount-Everest
Highest Peak in the world
This project is a showcase of my HTML, CSS and Javascript learning. I have also used a Bootstrap in couple places. There are two HTML files - Index.html and secondPage.html. There are also two exernal CSS files - style.css and car.css. Both of these files are inside the CSS folder. The car.css stylesheet and secondPage.html are mainly for the carousel. For the responsive design, I have used the Flexbox in which for mobile device the number of columns will reduce to one and similarly the navigation links will switch to toggle menu. I have used Bootstrap for toggle menu icon and Javascript for displaying/hiding the links when toggle menu is clicked. In the same way I have used Bootstrap for play and pause icons in carousel and Javascript to play/pause the slides.

### Issues
Below are few issues that I am aware of in this site:
Distortion of images on mobile devices.
Toggle menu in mobile devices requires two click (mostly the first time) to display the navigation links.
slight difference in the size of the page/header when swithcing between the pages.
Blank space between the footer and the carousel in second page in mobile devices.

Please let me know if you have any feedback/suggestion or found some issues in this site.
